  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>Links look like this: <a href="http://www.facebook.com">link to facebook</a>. You specify where you want the link to point by specifying the 'href' inside the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>

  <p>The href can also point to local files. For example, <a href="./example.html">this</a> is a link to this page you're reading at the moment. Notice that the protocol and host part of the URL has been replaced by a "."</p>

  <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>Images are a bit like links. You specify the location of the image with the 'src' property in the &lt;img&gt; tag. Note that img tags are like br tags: they don't come in pairs. The 'alt' property should be used to provide a description of the image in case it won't load or the user is partially sighted.</p>

  <p>Images can be stored on the same host ... </p>
  <img src="./local_image.png" alt="A local image">

  <p>... or on another server entirely.</p>
